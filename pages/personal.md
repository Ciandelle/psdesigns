## Ethos
I'm passionate about understanding the difference that small but systemic changes can make to a person's life. I believe that having a person first approach makes a difference, and that accessibility is a human right. 

I truly believe that for change to be effective, we must first understand why something is happening, and to facilitate change we must provide the means for it to happen.

## Personal life
I live in Herefordshire with my husband and 2 cats. I'm pretty introverted and spend most of my time reading, playing computer games or learning new things. 

I also love all types of music. I'm a big fan of soundtracks to tv shows to help me concentrate, but I also love a varied array of music. I'm also love going to see music live when I can.  

### Health
In 2021 I was diagnosed with stage 1 non-small cell lung cancer. As a result I'm very health conscious, and take a lot of precautions especially during winter months. I have some other chronic conditions but overall I manage pretty well.
